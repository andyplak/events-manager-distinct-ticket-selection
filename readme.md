### Events Manager - Distinct Ticket Selection

Contributors: socarrat

Tags: Events Manager, Single Ticket

Requires at least: 3.0.1

Tested up to: 4.1

Stable tag: 1.0

### Description

Forces an WordPress [Events Manager](http://wp-events-plugin.com/) user to select a single ticket type from those available.

Modifies the Events booking form ticket list so that instead of having select drop downs per each ticket, there is a single checkbox per ticket, for which a user can only select a single ticket. This is designed for use where there is a requirement to allow a user to purchase just a single ticket per booking, chosing the ticket type they want.

Ticket display will look something like this:

When using this plugin it makes sense to configure the event tickets "At most 1 space per booking" along with setting "Maximum Spaces Per Booking" to 1.

### Installation

Same as you would any other WordPress plugin
